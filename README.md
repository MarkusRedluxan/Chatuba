# Chatuba

chatuba - chat _bah tchÃª_

A simple chat that you can use on a local network.

**WARNING:** It's really not secure!

## Motivation

I just wanted to create a simple chat using Python sockets.
That's it!

## Install

It's just a joke, you don't need to install it :P

Just run the scripts using Python 3:

```sh
python3 server.py # launch a chatuba server
# or
python3 client.py # start a chatuba client
```
